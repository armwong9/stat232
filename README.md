# STAT232: Experimental Design Final Project
We investigate the use of various methods in obtaining the optimal individualised treatment rules. The dataset comes from a study (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986892/) which uses a randomised trial to study Expert-led and artificial intelligence (AI) system-assisted tutoring course to increase confidence of Chinese medical interns on suturing and ligature skills.

Our code employs the Rpackages (https://github.com/QuantLet/Meta_learner-for-Causal-ML/tree/main) and (https://github.com/MichaelLLi/evalITR).
